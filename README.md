**Project Overview**
This project focused on helping a restaurant consolidator identify star restaurants and generate recommendations using two datasets: restaurant data and country codes.

**Data Import and Inspection**

The datasets were imported into Python for structure analysis, missing value checks, and duplicate detection. Duplicates were removed, missing data was handled, and the datasets were merged with country codes to support geographical analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis**

EDA was performed to identify cities with the most and fewest restaurants, franchises with the widest presence, the ratio of restaurants offering table booking, and the percentage providing online delivery. Vote differences between delivery and non-delivery restaurants were also analyzed to gauge customer engagement.

**Cuisine, Cost, and Ratings Analysis**

Top cuisines across cities were identified, along with restaurants offering the widest and narrowest variety. Cost distribution patterns were studied, and the relationship between ratings and factors such as cuisines offered, cost, delivery, and table booking availability was examined.

**Dashboard Creation**

Insights were presented through an interactive Tableau dashboard, visualizing locations, cuisines, costs, and ratings to support easy exploration and identification of star restaurants for recommendations.
